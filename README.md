# Craft Store – Handcrafted E-commerce Platform

Craft Store is a full-stack MERN-based e-commerce platform built to empower handicraft creators and small businesses by providing them with a digital space to showcase and sell their handmade products.

This project is deeply inspired by my childhood passion for papercraft, toy design, and architectural models, and by observing how many skilled artisans struggle to reach a wider audience due to limited access to online platforms.

## Problem Statement

- Many talented handicraft workers rely only on local markets.
- Limited reach restricts their income and growth potential.
- There is a lack of accessible platforms focused on handcrafted and cultural products.

Craft Store bridges this gap by enabling artisans to sell their creations online while preserving traditional and cultural crafts.
